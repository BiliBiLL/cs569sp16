============= TSTL Papers ==========

There are a few early papers on a version of TSTL with a less readable
(but still supported) syntax:

ISSTA tool paper on TSTL:

NASA Formal Methods longer paper on TSTL:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~agroce/nfm15.pdf

Submitted journal paper on "modern" TSTL:

tstl.pdf (in this repository!)

The place to start is probably the last paper.  The others are
potentially useful reading as well, as are the .tstl files in the
tstl/examples directories on the TSTL github repo.
